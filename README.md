# Fast Front end assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What were the most difficult tasks?

Per React, there wasn't any difficulty per se. Just needed to brush up on using the axios instance.

## Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?

Now I know how to deploy to github pages (I haven't done that before and I learnt it here)

## What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?

Did not add transitions, loading state actually styling from thin air took the most time. Also I wasn't sure for the background requirement for favourite colour was for just the footer or the page as a whole (I assumed the footer.)

## How could the application be improved?

I could have used typescript and emotion to not use sass. Add more comments. Make the search page similar to the playlist page.
